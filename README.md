# rps-redux

RPS Redux is a DOM manipulation version of the JavaScript Rock-Paper-Scissors I had written.

Possible changes moving forward would be to change the scoreline to different messages depending on the score, e.g.:
- "The computer's winning 3-1, you need to turn this around fast!"
- "Computer? More like comp-LOSER, you're winning 4-0!"

The rest of this is pretty much done, though with more experience I can double-back and evaluation my code to see how I can change it to improve readability or functionality.

Styled with CSS.
